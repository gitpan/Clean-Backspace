Clean-Backspace version 1.03
============================

NAME

    Clean::Backspace - removes hidden backspaces and their corresponding deleted characters in strings

SYNOPSIS

    use Clean::Backspace;
    my $clean = Clean::Backspace->new();
    $clean->backspace(\@list_of_string_refs);

DESCRIPTION

    This module removes "hidden" backspaces and their corresponding deleted characters from strings. 
    Some terminals generate the backspace control character ^H when backspacing. This is due to how 
    that particular terminal is configured. When terminals are configured to generate ^H instead of 
    ascii del the ^H character as well as the deleted character are retained in the string. If the 
    terminal is configured in this manner and the backspace is used the string may appear to be normal.

    An example string on such a terminal could be the string 'test'. Let's say it was typed like this:
    ted<backspace>st

    When you look at the string it appears as 'test'. There are various mechanisms to detect the 
    hidden characters and the string is actually 'ted^Hst'. This can cause problems in various IT
    infrastructures because all characters in the string will be interpreted. One example could be
    with an Oracle database. The strings that are typed with backspaces might look normal in your
    terminal but when you look at Oracle database table fields the unwanted characters might be visible.   

INSTALLATION
